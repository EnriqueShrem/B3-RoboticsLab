# Robotics Lab Final Tasks - Group B3
In this repository we cover the work done for the Final Tasks in the Introduction to Robotics Tutorial course as the group B3. See also: [Introduction to Robotics course](https://github.com/EnriqueShrem/B3-Robotics).

Members: Jose Flores, Danna Lopez, Facundo Rolon, Enrique Shrem

## Course Overview
In the Introduction to Robotics Tutorial course, we work with industrial robots (EPSON and ABB) to make practices and achieve specific tasks, we cover topics such as:
- Instalation of the I/O connections
- Programing with respectives robot software
- Simulation of the tasks
- Robot usage to perform the tasks

Enviroment materials:
- Tokens: two types, coin and block
- Feeder: a platform with vertically aligned tokens (stacked by types)
- Tray: a platform with multiple sockets for the tokens (3 for each type)
- Fixture: a platform used for the alignment of the tokens with the tool

This and other materials have been used for the performing the tasks.

## Final Tasks
### [Task 1: Pick and Place](Task%201%3A%20Pick%20and%20Place.md)
Moves tokens from feeder to the fixture, aligns them and then precisely inserts them into the tray, repites the process reversely.
